A vacant lot viewer web framework built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). The framework makes it relatively easy to make sites like the ones [596 Acres](http://596acres.org) has been involved in--maps that show vacant lots and let users organize around those lots--relatively easily. The framework consists of a series of Django modules that you plug in as needed, which you can find under [596 Acres' Github organization](https://github.com/596acres/).

I wrote and maintain all of the code in this framework, which is an abstraction of the first 596 Acres site.
