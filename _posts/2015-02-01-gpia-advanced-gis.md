This class presents an introduction to web mapping for students who have a foundation in GIS concepts and desktop GIS software. CartoDB is used to get students used to web mapping, then the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are covered to get students making more advanced web maps. The class is part of The New School's [Graduate Program in International Affairs](http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/ma-ms-international-affairs/). I developed this class and have taught it three times: in the Spring of 2014, 2015, and 2016.
