The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Environmental Monitoring Map displays environmental monitoring sites in the Hudson River estuary. The map allows viewers to filter the data to show sites that monitor for indicators such as water quality and ecological health.

In coordination with [Pratt SAVI](https://commons.pratt.edu/savi/), I worked with the data, developed the site in React, including the map which uses Mapbox GL.
