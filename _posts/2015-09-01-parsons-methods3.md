This class presents an introduction to GIS concepts and software using the free, open source QGIS, as well as an introduction to web mapping. Map concepts such as projections and overlay operations are covered, as are less GIS-centric topics such as creating and accessing data through OpenStreetMap and other collaborative data project. The class is a design methods class in the graduate [Design and Urban Ecologies](http://sds.parsons.edu/designurbanecologies/) program at [Parsons](http://urban.parsons.edu/). I co-developed this course and have taught it three times: in the Fall of 2013, 2014, and 2015.
