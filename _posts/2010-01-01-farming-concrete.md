Farming Concrete produces methods that help community gardeners measure the good things growing in their farm or garden. This ranges from food production to composting to improving the moods of people who participate in activities at the farm or garden.

I have worked on Farming Concrete since its inception in 2010 and helped set the project's goals and organize its data. In the process I built an [open source](https://github.com/ebrelsford/Farming-Concrete) data entry tool for the project ([the Barn](https://farmingconcrete.org/barn/)) and a public data portal ([the Mill](https://farmingconcrete.org/mill/)).
