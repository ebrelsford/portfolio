NYCommons is an online platform that gives New Yorkers information about public housing, parks, libraries, community gardens, and other publicly held spaces in their city. The platform provides tools for tracking these spaces in anticipation of potential development on those spaces.

I collected and cleaned the data and developed the site using the Living Lots framework I developed with 596 Acres.
