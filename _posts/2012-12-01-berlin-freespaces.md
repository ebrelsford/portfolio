Berlin Freespaces maps squats and free culture spaces in Berlin in a nicely searchable manner. Artist Jaime Iglehart did the research behind the map. You can see Jaime talk about it at GeoNYC in [this video](https://vimeo.com/111900628#t=34m05s).

I normalized the data in CartoDB and created the site.
