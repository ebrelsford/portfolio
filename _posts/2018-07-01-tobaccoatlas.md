The Tobacco Atlas visualizes numerous issues around tobacco production, sale, and use around the world. The Atlas is both a printed book and a website, and the two share many of the same visualizations.

In coordination with [Radish Lab](https://radishlab.com/), I worked with the data, developed the visualizations in D3, and coordinated getting the visualizations into a format suitable for print and integrated into the website. I also created a JavaScript library to allow site administrators to create new visualizations.
