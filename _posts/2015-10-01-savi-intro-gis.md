This class presents an introduction to GIS concepts and software using the free, open source QGIS. Map concepts such as projections and overlay operations are covered, as are less GIS-centric topics such as creating and accessing data through OpenStreetMap and other collaborative data projects. The class is part of Pratt Institute's [Spatial Analysis and Visualization Initiative (SAVI)](https://www.pratt.edu/pratt-research-and-centers/spatial-analysis-visualization-initiative/). 

I developed this QGIS-based version of the class and taught it in the Fall of 2015.
