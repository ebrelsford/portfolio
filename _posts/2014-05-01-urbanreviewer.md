A map of all the urban renewal plans ever enacted in New York City. As far as we know, this is the only digital version of this data. Volunteers spent hundreds of hours in City records offices digitizing this data, and we spent many more hours rectifying the circa-1960s parcel outlines with current day geometries. I was involved in cleaning the data and developing the site.
