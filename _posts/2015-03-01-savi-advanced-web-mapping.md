This class is an advanced web mapping course that assumes students have a strong foundation in web mapping with Leaflet. The course covers in-browser GIS functions with Turf, using APIs such as CartoDB's SQL API, and other advanced JavaScript topics. As part of Pratt Institute's [Spatial Analysis and Visualization Initiative (SAVI)](https://www.pratt.edu/pratt-research-and-centers/spatial-analysis-visualization-initiative/),

I developed and taught the class in the Spring of 2015 and the Spring of 2016.
