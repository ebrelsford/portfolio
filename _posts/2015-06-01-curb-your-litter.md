Curb Your Litter is a map of street litter in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. It includes complaints about garbage (from NYC's 311 system), locations of current garbage cans (surveyed by client), cleanliness ratings for each block (also surveyed by client), and locations where garbage cans have been requested (user-submitted).

I collected some of the data via APIs, developed the map, and developed the can location submission sequence.
