Projestions (short for "projection suggestions") attempts to make map projection recommendations based on the area you are mapping within. It uses the [EPSG](http://www.epsg.org/)'s "area of use" data to find a list of reasonable projections, then sorts the projections using the method of your choosing. There is a [public API](https://github.com/ebrelsford/projestions#api), a [demo of the API in use](https://projest.io/ns/), and a [QGIS plugin](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Projestions/) that uses the API.
