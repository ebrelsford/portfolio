A map of US-based organizations whose missions deal with food workers, including advocacy groups, unions, and workers centers. Interested food workers can find contact information for organizations in their cities. The map was made in conjunction with [Food Chain Workers Alliance](http://foodchainworkers.org/) and the film-makers behind the documentary [The Hand That Feeds](http://thehandthatfeedsfilm.com/).

I normalized the data and developed the site.
