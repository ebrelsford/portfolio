A map of organizations that have missions dealing with food workers, including advocacy groups, unions, and workers centers, in the United States. Interested food workers can find contact information for organizations in their cities. The map was made in conjunction with [Food Chain Workers Alliance](http://foodchainworkers.org/) and the documentary [The Hand That Feeds](http://thehandthatfeedsfilm.com/).

I normalized the data and developed the site.
