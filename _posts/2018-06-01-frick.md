The History of Art Collecting Map gives users of The Frick Collection's [Archives for the History of Collecting in America](http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/home.php) a map interface to search and browse the individuals catalogued in the archives. Users can search by the role of the person and the years they were active.

I worked with the data, developed the filters in React, and created the map using Mapbox GL.
