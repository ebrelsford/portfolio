596 Acres maps vacant public land in New York City and works with communities that want to get access to that land.

I started working with 596 Acres just after its inception. I helped design the original user experience, cleaned the data, and built the technology that has driven the organization since. With 596 Acres, I created an open source web framework for making sites like ours, [Living Lots](https://github.com/596acres/django-livinglots).
