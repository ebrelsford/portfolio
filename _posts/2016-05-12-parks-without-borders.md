A short talk about how 596 Acres used NYC's open data to get started and how it has used it since.

This talk was part of the [Parks Without Borders Summit](https://www.nycgovparks.org/planning-and-building/planning/parks-without-borders/summit) held by the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation at The New School in May 2016.
